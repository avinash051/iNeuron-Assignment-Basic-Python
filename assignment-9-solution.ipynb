The Shelve Module of Python is a very popular module of Python which works like an effective tool for persistent data storage inside files using a Python program. As the name of this module suggests, i.e., Shelve, we can easily interpret that it will work as a shelf object to keep all our data inside a file and save all the necessary information. In the Shelve Module, a shelf object is defined, which acts like a dictionary-type object, and it is persistently stored in the disk file of our computer. That's how we can save all the data and information through Python Shelve Module in our system and keep it till whenever we want."
